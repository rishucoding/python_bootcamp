The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few
rules:

1. Names can not start with a number.
2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
3. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that the names are lowercase.

# We can also use a function called len() to check the length of a 
string!

# indexing starts at 0

# Strings are immutable types. 

# lists are mutable.
